        <img src="Glorillablue.jpg" class="bioGlo">
        <p id="bio">Born Gloria Hallelujah Woods on July 28, 1999, GloRilla is an American rapper from Memphis, Tennessee. She is the eighth out of 10 children. She was 
            homeschooled until fifth grade and later attended Melrose High School in Memphis. She initially wanted to be a singer because she grew up as a part of her church's 
            choir. However, she pivoted to rapping after losing her voice. She started rapping when she turned 16. She released her mixtape <i>Most Likely Up Next</i> in 2019 
            and her EP <i>P Status</i> in 2020.<br><br>In April 2022, she garnered more popularity when she released "F.N.F. (Let's Go)" with producer Hitkidd. The song went
            viral and led to a #FNFChallenge on TikTok. The song led her to be nominated for two awards at the 2022 BET Hip Hop Awards, where she also performed in October. 
            In July 2022, GloRilla signed with fellow Memphis rapper Yo Gotti's Collective Music Group. In 2024, she released the top-40 songs "Yeah Glo!" and "Wanna Be" 
            with Megan Thee Stallion as singles from her debut commercial mixtape, <i>Ehhthang, Ehhthang</i>, which was released on April 5. Later that year on October 11,
            she released her debut album <i>Glorious</i>, preceded by the singles "Hollon" and "TGIF" (which peaked at 28 on the <i>Billboard</i> Hot 100). The album peaked
            at 5 on the <i>Billboard</i> 200 and was the best-selling rap album by a female artist in 2024.
